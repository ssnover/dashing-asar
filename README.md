# Dashing ASAR
Re-implementation of the main pipeline of my senior design project under ROS2 Dashing.

This purpose of this project is for me to learn ROS2 using the newly released Dashing LTS release. 
It is based on my multidisciplinary senior design project from my senior year at RIT. 
If I had known what ROS was at the time and how to use it, I most certainly would have taken advantage of it.
But instead here we are finally writing it in a framework which makes sense.
